# Coding Practices

This day will contain 3 examples, designed to get the students familiar with problems encounted when writing code in a collaborative fashion with many poeple. 


## (Example 1) Code Golf - And The Unreadability Problem

For this example we will have students write small code which incentivises them to accomplish a task in as few lines as possible, and then be forced to modify that code to change behavior. The goal is for students to learn the value of code readability. 

### Class is split into 2 groups
#### Group 1 
will be coding the ```fizzbuzz``` example

#### Group 2 
 will be coding the ```robotmove``` example

Useful syntax to help in the code golf excercise:
```
a%b #modulus
str.split() #split a string by delimeter into an array of strings
int(string_instance) #cast a string to a number such that math can be done upon it
```

## (Example 2) Class Inheritance Trap
### Class is split into 2 groups


For this example, half the students will inherit vehicle instance code which does an example from day 1 perfectly.
